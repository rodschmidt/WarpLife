<h1 id="top">The Main Screen</h1>

<p class="md">The Main Screen is where you run the game as well as edit the
grid.</p>

<ul>
<li class="c"><a href="contents.html">Contents</a></li>
</ul>

<p>When Warp Life first starts up, it enters the Main Screen in Edit Mode.

Initially all the cells in the grid are dead, so every cell in the grid will
be blue.  Grid lines appear when in Edit Mode so that you know where every cell
is located, as well as how big it is.</p>

<div class="illus"><img class="illus" src="i/Edit_Mode.png"
alt="Main Screen in Edit Mode" />
<p class="cap">Main Screen in Edit Mode</p></div>

<p>At the bottom of the screen are some buttons:</p>

<ul>
<li>New kills every cell in the grid</li>
<li>Cut copies any selected cells to the Clipboard, while leaving behind 
nothing but dead cells where the Selection was</li>
<li>Copy copies any selected cells to the Clipboard without altering the
grid</li>
<li>Clear kills all of the selected cells that were previously alive</li>
<li>Paste puts the contents of the Clipboard in the center of the screen,
then selects the rectangular array of cells that is just put there.</li>
</ul>

<p>A totally dead grid doesn't do anything interesting - it just stays dead 
forever.  Edit Mode allows you to bring dead cells to life or to kill living
cells.</p>

<p>Single-tap some of the cells to toggle them from dead to living.  For
example if you place three living cells in a vertical column or horizontal row,
you'll make the Animal known as a Blinker.</p>

<div class="illus">
<img class="illus" src="i/Blinker_Edit.png"
  alt="Blinker in Edit Mode" />
<p class="cap">Blinker in Edit Mode</p></div>

<p>You can operate the automaton - that is, advance the generations - when in
Run Mode.  Tap the Run button on the Navigation Bar at the top of the screen to
enter Run mode.</p>

<p>Note that when you switch from Edit to Run mode, the label on that button
changes to "Edit".  It's telling you what mode you will enter if you tap it.
</p>

<div class="illus"><img class="illus" src="i/Run_Mode.png"
 alt="Main Screen in Run Mode" />
<p class="cap">Main Screen in Run Mode</p></div>

<p>Note that the grid lines disappear when you enter Run mode.  We worked night
and day for months to figure out all kinds of ways to make Warp Life run
faster.  Much of that work focussed on speeding up the display update for each
new generation.  It takes time to draw the grid lines; by not drawing the grid
lines at all in Run mode,  each new generation can be displayed in less time,
thereby enabling Warp Life to run a litte bit faster.</p>

<p>Press the Step button a few times to watch the evolution of your pattern.
The Step button advances the grid by just one generation then stops.
If you entered a Blinker, it will oscillate between horizontal and vertical.
</p>

<div class="illus">
<img class="illus" src="i/Step_Button.png"
  alt="Step Button" />
<p class="cap">Step Button</p></div>

<p>Now press the Run button.  You'll see your pattern evolve rapidly; if you
entered a Blinker, you'll see it oscillate rapidly between horizontal and
vertical.</p>

<div class="illus">
<img class="illus" src="i/Run_Button.png" alt="Run Button" />
<p class="cap">Run Button</p></div>

<p>With the Speed slider all the way to the right, the generations advance as
fast as Warp Life's software and your iOS device are able to make them go.</p>

<div class="illus">
<img class="illus" src="i/Speed_Slider.png"
alt="Speed Slider" />
<p class="cap">Speed Slider at Maximum Speed</p></div>

<p>While it is running, move the indicator on the Speed slider to the left.
The advance of generations slows down.  Moving the indicator to the right
speeds the generations back up.</p>
